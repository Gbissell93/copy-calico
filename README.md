# Copy Calico

Now that we have become masters of Copy Kitten let's become masters of Copy Calico. I think we are ready to get to the big Leagues and show our skills.

Below you will find a list of the websites that you have been requested to copy by Copy Calico so we get access to the next league.  Don't worry you don't have to copy all of them, you only have to choose one and work with that one. ONLY ONE!

## List of the Websites to choose from:

* [Google](https://www.google.com/) 
* [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/?t=hp&atb=v171-1_p)
* [Wildflower](http://wildflower.resn.co.nz/)
* [The Office Of Jason James](http://www.theofficeofjasonjames.com/)
* [Bhav Mistry](http://bhavmistry.net/)

Remember our project rules, make sure you create a repo on GitHub before you start working on the Copy Calico project on your local machine. Always commit with a clear message and often. 

### Stretch Goal 

If you finished copying that website, challenge yourself and copy another one. It will supply you with a whole other set of challenges!
